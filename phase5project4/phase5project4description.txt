DESCRIPTION

Project objective: 
 developing an environment for Docker networking. 


Background of the problem statement: 

As you have worked on Docker containers previously, your manager has asked you to perform container scheduling over multiple hosts using Docker CLI and connect multiple hosts with Docker containers.


You must use the following: 

● Jenkins: To create a pipeline to deploy Docker Swarm
● Docker Swarm: To implement container networking
● Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub 
● GitHub: To store the Angular application


Following requirements should be met: 

● A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.
● Submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.
● The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.

note:the process of developing docker can be doone by using mobaxtreme .
